Books are a powerful source that helps a person to expand their horizons of understanding this world, and gives the opportunity to relax, immersed in a fantastic environment. However, in our time, books are becoming less and less valued. That's why we decided to create a BuyBook project.BuyBook is an online store, where you can buy books of any choice. 
Advantages of our store: 
- the ability to purchase both electronic and printed copies;
- a wide range of choices; 
- simple and user-friendly interface;
- affordable prices.
The purpose of our project is to promote books in society, to make books available to those who due to certain circumstances are not able to buy them in a bookstore.
